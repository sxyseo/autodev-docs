# Model Context Protocol (MCP)

> MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs. Think of MCP like a USB-C port for
> AI applications. Just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect your devices to various peripherals and
> accessories, MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools.

In issue [#330](https://github.com/unit-mesh/auto-dev/issues/330), we discussed the possibility of using AutoDev as a
MCP server.
This document will discuss the implementation details.

Requirements: Install Node.js with Npx
