## Refactoring

User: The current code logic isn't conceptual enough and is somewhat difficult to understand  
Assistant: Your issue is that the current DirInsCommand class logic lacks conceptual clarity and is challenging to comprehend. I will improve code readability and conceptual clarity through refactoring.

Implementation steps:
- Introduce explicit data models to represent directory structures
- Separate presentation logic from data collection logic
- Simplify the recursive traversal algorithm
- Enhance naming expressiveness
- Add more comments to explain design rationale
