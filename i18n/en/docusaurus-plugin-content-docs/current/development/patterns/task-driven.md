In issue [#79](https://github.com/unit-mesh/auto-dev/issues/79), we defined the concept of "task-driven AI generation"
as a method or concept that emphasizes the use of artificial intelligence (AI) generation targeted at specific tasks or
goals to meet particular needs or goals. In this context, tasks can refer to various modules in software development,
such as function blocks, class blocks, test methods, SQL snippets, code snippets, or even user requirements, among
others.
