## Custom Models

Documentation: [Custom Models](/customize/custom-llm-server)

As shown in the example below, you can configure different model types in AutoDev for use in different scenarios:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "GLM4-Plus",
    "url": "https://open.bigmodel.cn/api/paas/v4/chat/completions",
    "auth": {
      "type": "Bearer",
      "token": "sk-ii"
    },
    "requestFormat": "{ \"customFields\": {\"model\": \"glm-4-plus\", \"stream\": true}}",
    "responseFormat": "$.choices[0].delta.content",
    "modelType": "Others"
  },
  {
    "name": "DeepSeek R1",
    "url": "https://api.deepseek.com/chat/completions",
    "auth": {
      "type": "Bearer",
      "token": "sk-ii"
    },
    "requestFormat": "{ \"customFields\": {\"model\": \"deepseek-reasoner\", \"stream\": true}}",
    "responseFormat": "$.choices[0].delta.content",
    "modelType": "Plan"
  },
  {
    "name": "DS Completion",
    "url": "https://api.deepseek.com/beta/completions",
    "auth": {
      "type": "Bearer",
      "token": "sk-ii"
    },
    "requestFormat": "{ \"customFields\": {\"prompt\": \"$content\", \"model\": \"deepseek-chat\", \"max_tokens\": 128 }}",
    "responseFormat": "$.choices[0].delta.content",
    "modelType": "Completion"
  }
]
```

## Custom Prompt Actions

Documentation: [Custom Prompt Actions](/customize/custom-action)

1. Go to `Settings` -> `Tools` -> `AutoDev` -> `Agentic Customize`, and fill in the following JSON in the custom prompt Action.
2. Call it through the right-click menu.

```json
{
  "prompts": [
    {
      "title": " Code complete",
      "autoInvoke": true,
      "matchRegex": ".*",
      "priority": 1,
      "template": "Code complete:\n${METHOD_INPUT_OUTPUT}\n${SPEC_controller}\n\n${SELECTION}"
    },
    {
      "title": " Translate to Kotlin",
      "autoInvoke": false,
      "matchRegex": ".*",
      "priority": 0,
      "template": "Translate the following code to Kotlin.\n${SIMILAR_CHUNK}\nCompare these snippets:\n${METHOD_INPUT_OUTPUT}\nHere is the code:\n${SELECTION}"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Custom Team AI

Documentation: [Custom Team AI](/customize/custom-team-ai)

1. Create a `xx.vm` file in the `prompts` directory of the project with the following content.
2. Call it through `Alt` + `Enter` or the right-click menu.

```markdown

You are an experienced software development engineer who excels at developing software using TDD. You now need to help developers create good Tasking to facilitate writing test cases.

- Tasks generated by Tasking all have independent business value. Each completed task can be delivered independently and generate value.
- Using business-oriented Tasking with business language to describe task lists helps developers and business people communicate and confirm requirements in detail.
- Use the Given When Then writing format, where When represents system behavior.
- Consider business scenario coverage, and try to consider edge cases as much as possible.

Please output strictly according to the following format.

Example:

Question: Develop a taxi fare calculation function with the following calculation rules: when not exceeding 8 kilometers, charge 0.8 yuan per kilometer; when exceeding 8 kilometers, add a 50% long-distance fee per kilometer; during waiting time, add 0.25 yuan per minute.
Answer: ###
${commentSymbol} Given a taxi travels 5 kilometers (within 8 kilometers), with no waiting time, When calculating the fare, Then the charge is 4 yuan
${commentSymbol} Given a taxi travels 5 kilometers (within 8 kilometers), waiting for 10 minutes, When calculating the fare, Then the charge is 6.5 yuan
${commentSymbol} Given a taxi travels exactly 8 kilometers, with no waiting time, When calculating the fare, Then the charge is 6.4 yuan
${commentSymbol} Given a taxi travels exactly 8 kilometers, waiting for 10 minutes, When calculating the fare, Then the charge is 8.9 yuan
###
Question: ${selection}
Answer: ###
```

## Prompt Override

Documentation: [Prompt Override](/customize/prompt-override.md)

1. Create a `prompt/` folder in the project root directory.
2. Create prompt files with names that match the AutoDev prompt file names. For example, create a `gen-commit-msg.vm` file in the `practises` directory.
3. On the Git commit panel, select the AutoDev icon, and it will generate commit messages based on your prompt file.

Here is an example:

```markdown
Generate a commit message based on the following content:

${context.diffContent}

Must use Chinese.

# Please note that if your commit message does not comply with the specifications, it will be rejected.
```

## Custom Test Templates

Documentation: [Custom Test Templates](/customize/custom-test-template.md)

1. Create the corresponding test template files in the `prompts/templates` directory of the project.
    - Java language: `ControllerTest.java`, `ServiceTest.java`, `Test.java`
    - Kotlin language: `ControllerTest.kt`, `ServiceTest.kt`, `Test.kt`
2. These templates will be used when generating test files.
