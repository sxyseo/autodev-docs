TL;DR:

The first **barely usable** version of AutoDev Coder 6.7B, a coding LLM for AutoDev, is now available.

- HuggingFace homepage: [https://huggingface.co/unit-mesh](https://huggingface.co/unit-mesh/autodev-coder) (temporarily unable to provide direct downloads due to certification requirements üê∂üê∂).
- Dataset download: https://huggingface.co/datasets/unit-mesh/autodev-datasets

PS: Since AutoDev 1.5.1 is awaiting approval on the JetBrains Marketplace and foreign colleagues are still on vacation after holidays, the model's performance on version 1.5.1 will be **slightly** better than on 1.5.0.

Additionally, with improved computing power support and better completion testing, we will reintroduce the original Inlay completion mode.

## AutoDev Coder 6.7B v1 Experimental Version

Current version is fine-tuned based on DeepSeek Coder 6.7b instruct model under LLaMA architecture.

Note: As an experimental version, its primary purpose is to align the model, data tools, and IDE plugin for better coordination. Generation quality still requires further improvement.

## AutoDev Coder 64k Dataset

The instruction composition of AutoDev Coder v1 64k is as follows:

| Filename                                | Selected Instructions |
|----------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| java_oss.jsonl                         | 4000                  |
| python_oss.jsonl                       | 4000                  |
| code_bugfix_cleaned_5K.json            | 4000                  |
| codeGPT_CN_cleaned_20K.json            | 15000                 |
| code_summarization_CN_cleaned_10K.json | 8000                  |
| code_generation_CN_cleaned_5K.json     | 4000                  |
| summary.jsonl                          | 25000                 |

The summary.jsonl is generated by our open-source code fine-tuning data framework UnitGen (https://github.com/unit-mesh/unit-gen).

We selected dozens of Java and Kotlin open-source projects, generating instructions based on AutoDev plugin requirements, mainly categorized into three types:

- Completion (inline, interline, interblock)
- Documentation generation
- Comment generation

Detailed documentation can be found in the UnitGen project: https://github.com/unit-mesh/unit-gen.

## FAQ: AutoDev Coder Model Evaluation

Still under design. Since we need to combine AutoDev instructions with languages like Java, Kotlin, TypeScript rather than the Python-centric systems commonly used in open-source models, we need to rethink our evaluation approach.

Initially, we used instruction sets like OSS Instruct to supplement natural language to code generation, but found ~50,000 instructions (about 50%) were Python-related. After filtering, only ~5,000 Java instructions remained, which showed suboptimal results in AutoDev.

## FAQ: AutoDev Instructions

AutoDev employs contextual strategies that differ from other tools in instruction handling. Details: https://github.com/unit-mesh/auto-dev
