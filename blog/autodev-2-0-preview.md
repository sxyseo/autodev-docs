A little over two weeks ago, after the release of DeepSeek V3, we introduced multi-file editing capabilities for Shire.

Following extensive testing, we discovered that DeepSeek V3 performs exceptionally well in programming scenarios,
especially in multi-file editing contexts.

This inspired us to add a new featureâ€”**AutoDev Composer**â€”to AutoDev, which had long lacked major updates. In
developing this feature, we drew inspiration from a number of mature tools:

- The impressive **Sketch rendering mechanism** on Shire
- Complex **system prompts** from tools like Cursor and WindSurf
- The bug-ridden **StreamDiff mode** from Continue
- â€¦and more

Now, thereâ€™s no need to switch to a VSCode-like IDE to craft prompts and then return to IntelliJ IDEA for debugging.
With AutoDev Composer, you can handle everything directly within IntelliJ IDEA.

As an amateur project, weâ€™ve put in a lot of effort to make this happen! ðŸ˜Š

### **Decoding AutoDev Composer System Prompts**

#### **Project Context**

In Composer mode, you can still experience our understanding of software engineering and our extensive expertise in
software component analysis. Below is the basic contextual prompt for AutoDev Composer:

```markdown
- The USER's OS version is Mac OS X 15.2 x86_64
- The absolute path of the USER's workspaces is: /Users/phodal/IdeaProjects/untitled
- This workspace uses Gradle and Java JDK_11
- The user's shell is /bin/bash
- User's workspace context is: This project uses MariaDB 11.5.2-MariaDB, Spring Boot 2.7.10, Spring MVC, and JDBC to
  build RESTful APIs.
- Current time is: 2025-01-20 11:23:59  
```  

We gather system, workspace, toolchain, database, and language environment information to help you work more
efficiently. For example, when writing CRUD code, AutoDev generates corresponding code based on your database
information.

#### **Tool Context**

Unlike FunctionTool, we firmly believe that DSLs (Domain-Specific Languages) are the best approach for generative AI
solutions. Therefore, AutoDev adopts a DevIns DSL tool-calling mechanism:

```markdown
<tool>name: file, desc: Read the content of a file by project relative path, example:  
<devin>  
Locate a specific file (the file must exist in the specified path)  
/file:.github/dependabot.yml#L1C1-L2C12  
Search globally by file name (case-sensitive, no path required)  
/file:PythonFrameworkContextProvider.kt  
</devin>  
```  

Since the toolâ€™s documentation is part of the code and test suite, it allows for the generation of precise and reliable
prompts.

### **Thought Process**

Given the complexity of the AutoDev DSL tools, we referenced WindSurfâ€™s prompt generation approach and introduced a
step-by-step **thought process**:

```markdown
# Step 1. Create `routes.py`

Iâ€™ve created `routes.py` to define the `/upload` and `/query` endpoints. Additionally, Iâ€™ve added `/` as the endpoint
for `main.html`.

# Step 2. Create `main.js`

Iâ€™ve created a dedicated `main.js` file to store all the interactive front-end code. It defines UI elements for
displaying windows and buttons and creates event listeners for these buttons.  
```  

This allows us to provide additional examples for the AI model, which has proven to learn remarkably well.

### **AutoDev Developer Experience: Sketch Mode**

Although AutoDev is now an amateur project, we firmly believe that understanding developer experience is at the core of
AI-assisted development. For this reason, weâ€™ve introduced Sketch mode from Shireâ€™s intelligent agent language into
AutoDev Composer. With Sketch, you can transform code into *everything*.

Simply put, Markdown is rendered with various UIs to enable better interactivity.

#### **Diff Sketch Mode**

With Diff Sketch mode, you can quickly understand AI-generated code changes and decide how to handle them: view the
source file, examine the diff, or apply the changes directly.

Since we currently lack the capacity to offer a diff model like Cursor, weâ€™ve implemented a repair model. When patches
cannot be accurately identified, the model is called again for corrections.

#### **Terminal Sketch Mode**

In AutoDev, the Terminal Sketch mode allows you to execute scripts or pop out a terminal (similar to Cursor), enabling
you to run commands and view the results conveniently.

#### **Mermaid and PlantUML Sketch Modes**

When you install the Mermaid or PlantUML plugins, you can use their respective Sketch modes to convert your code into
flowcharts, sequence diagrams, and more.
